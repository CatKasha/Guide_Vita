You will COMPLETELY uninstall the Henkaku Ensō custom firmware from your device. To reinstall, go through the process detailed in the guide again. If anything goes wrong, there is no recovery. You take sole responsibility in what happens to your device.
:::

### What You Need

* A Henkaku Ensō console on system firmware 3.65 or 3.60
  + If you only have h-encore installed (and aren't running Ensō for whatever reason), reboot your console to remove CFW.
* An Internet connection
  + Make sure that Flight Mode is disabled and Wi-Fi is enabled.

### Instructions

1. Open the Settings application.
1. Navigate to "HENkaku Settings".
1. Disable the "Enable Version Spoofing" setting if it is on.
1. Reboot your device.
1. While the console is starting, hold the L button. This will disable any custom plugins running on your Vita.
1. Once the console has been rebooted, open the Settings application.
1. Navigate to "System".
1. Click on "System Information", and verify that the System Software does not say 3.73 or 変革.
1. Navigate out of the "System" menu and open "System Update". 
1. Select "Update using Wi-Fi".
1. There should be a message onscreen saying "A new version of the system software is avaliable."
    + If you changed your mind, exit out of the updater.
1. Click "Next".
1. Click "Yes" to the onscreen prompt to confirm the closing of all other running applications.
1. Scroll to the bottom of the Software License Agreement and click "Accept".
1. Click the "Update" button to update the system software and remove Henkaku Ensō.
1. The Vita will now download and install the system software update.

Your device will then install firmware version 3.73, and Henkaku Ensō will be wiped from your system. Once finished, it will reboot into stock mode. User-installed titles will still show up on the screen, however they will not be accessible. Delete the bubbles or format your device if this is a problem.
