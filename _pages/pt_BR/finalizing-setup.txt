### Required Reading

We will now setup applications and plugins such as the following:

+  **Vita Homebrew Browser** *(allows for installing homebrew applications from the internet)*
+  **iTLS Installer** *(adds TLSv1.2 support in older firmwares for online connection)*

In order to install the necessary `.vpk` (content package) file on your device, we use the [File Transfer Protocol (FTP)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) to copy the files to your device's memory card.

### What You Need

* An FTP Client such as [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/) or [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/)
  + Alternatively, you can also use the USB transfer feature of VitaShell
* The latest release of [Vita Homebrew Browser](https://github.com/devnoname120/vhbb/releases/latest/)
* The latest release of [iTLS-Enso](https://github.com/SKGleba/iTLS-Enso/releases/latest/)
