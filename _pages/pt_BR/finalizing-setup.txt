### Required Reading

We will now setup applications and plugins such as the following:

+  **NoNpDrm** *(allows for encrypted games and applications to be used)*
+  **0syscall6** *(allows using games and applications that require higher firmware versions)*
+  **DownloadEnabler** *(allows any file type to be downloaded with the browser)*
+  **shellbat** *(displays exact battery percentage in the status bar)*
+  **pngshot** *(improves the built-in screenshot utility)*
+  **PSVshell** *(allows overclocking the PSVita for better performances as well as showing cpu usage and fps counter)*

In order to install the necessary `.vpk` (content package) file on your device, we use the [File Transfer Protocol (FTP)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) to copy the files to your device's memory card.

### What You Need

* An FTP Client such as [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/) or [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/)
  + Alternatively, you can also use the USB transfer feature of VitaShell
* [config.txt]({{ "/assets/files/config.txt" | absolute_url }}){:download="config.txt"}
* The latest release of [NoNpDrm](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/NoNpDrm/releases/latest)
* The latest release of [0syscall6](https://github.com/SKGleba/0syscall6/releases/latest)
* The latest release of [DownloadEnabler](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/VitaTweaks/releases/tag/DownloadEnabler)
* The latest release of [shellbat](https://github.com/nowrep/vita-shellbat/releases/latest)
* The latest release of [pngshot](https://github.com/xyzz/pngshot/releases/latest)
* The latest release of [PSVshell](https://github.com/Electry/PSVshell)

### Instructions

#### Section I - Prep Work

1. Launch the VitaShell application
1. Press (Start) to open the VitaShell settings
1. Press (Cross) on "SELECT button" to change the mode to "FTP"
  + Alternatively, you can leave this setting on "USB" and transfer all files via a USB cable for the remainder of this guide
  + Note that the USB transfer mode will start you in the ux0 partition
  + Additionally, some files will be hidden in USB mode on Windows; you must enable "Show hidden files, folders, and drives" and disable "Hide protected operating system files" in the File Explorer options in order to see all files
1. Press (Circle) to close the VitaShell settings
1. Press (Select) to enable FTP access on your device
1. Open your FTP client on your computer
1. Enter the IP Address and Port displayed on your device
1. Using your FTP client, navigate to `ux0:`
  + The `ux0:` partition corresponds to the memory card of your device (on the PS Vita 1000, this partition will always be the external memory card; on the PS Vita 2000 and PS TV, this partition will either be the external memory card if one is inserted, or the built-in memory card otherwise)
  + The `ur0:` partition corresponds to the internal system memory which is always present on all devices (on the PS Vita 2000 and PS TV, this is *not* the same as the built-in memory card!)
1. Delete the `tai` folder if it exists
1. Navigate to `ur0:` -> `tai/`
1. Transfer `config.txt` to  the `tai` folder
  + Overwrite (replace) the existing `config.txt` file
1. Transfer `nonpdrm.skprx` to the `tai` folder
1. Transfer `0syscall6.skprx` to the `tai` folder
1. Transfer `download_enabler.suprx` to the `tai` folder
1. Transfer `shellbat.suprx` to the `tai` folder
1. Transfer `pngshot.suprx` to the `tai` folder
1. Transfer `PSVshell.skprx` to the `tai` folder
1. Press (Circle) on your device to close the FTP connection
