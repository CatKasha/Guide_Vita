### Required Reading

YAMT (Yet Another Mount Tool) is a multi-purpose kernel plugin for the PS Vita (TV) which allows for the use of alternative storage devices such as a USB drive, an SD2Vita, or a psvd.

The SD2Vita is a microSD to game card adapter which is inserted into the game-card slot in your device, while the psvd is a microSD adapter which replaces the 3G modem on 3G PS Vita models.

By using the YAMT kernel plugin, the USB drive or microSD card you use will be mounted to `ux0:` just like a Sony memory card. This is very useful because microSD cards are significantly cheaper than Sony memory cards (especially at higher capacities).

This will use FTP (File Transfer Protocol) to transfer the files, so your Vita and PC must be connected to the same network.

YAMT is only compatible with firmware versions 3.60 and 3.65 on HENkaku Ensō.

{% capture notice-1 %}
If you want to reclaim the space on your memory card (to use for storing PSP games for instance), you can delete the contents of `uma0:` (the new memory card mount point) and / or `imc0:` (if you have a PS Vita 2000 or PS TV).

If you decide to do this, you must *not* delete these folders if they exist:

  + `uma0:data/bootstrap.self`
  + `uma0:app/PCSG90096`
  + `uma0:appmeta/PCSG90096`
  + `uma0:appmeta/VITASHELL`
  + `uma0:license/app/PCSG90096`
  + `uma0:license/app/VITASHELL`
  + `uma0:user/00/savedata/PCSG90096`
  + `uma0:user/00/savedata/VITASHELL`

This is because you must keep h-encore installed to the memory card so you can enable HENkaku (and therefore StorageMgr) after a reboot.
